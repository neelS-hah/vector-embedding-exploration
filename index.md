## What Really is Malware and Why Shouldn't I be Clicking on that Link? 
 - Introduce how users encounter malware in their day to day. Make the probelm relatable. 

--> Include picture/plot that shows scale of the problem at hand 

Explain through the lens of android applications since that's how the problem is set up. (Emphasize why the reader should care?)

The above should serve as a hook. 

Topic 2 - Introduce specific and driven problem statement. Along with the idea that this project takes an NLP driven approach to analyzing the problem.

## Overall Approach 
Topic 1 - Why our skillset is applicable for this project. Intended audience industry professionals.

Topic 2 - Define inspiration for merging discplines of core ML for malware detections as opposed to the idea of treating it more linguistically. 

## How Does One Even Access Malware Applications?
Topic 1 - This serves as our informal introduction to the project data. What it contains and how it also serves as training and testing data for further ML explorations

Topic 2 - A light explaination on procedure and what it took to pre-process the data

## A Story About Malware 
Topic 1 - Extracted findings from the EDA, trends of our dataset and other statistics that are derived from the dataset. 

This section will include plots and images to help understand the findings of our EDA, maybe a graph plot of all the api's and apps and their relations

Build the plot for the website to extend the understanding to current and state of the art for malware detection, what's currently used and what NLP techniques are proposed - Node2vec, MetaPath2Vec, Word2vec

Note - Will spend the most time explaining word2vec through examples and then using a related example for API's and Applications. 


## Our Results, Findings and Interesting Observations
Note - will provide hyperlinks and github repo references for technical aspects such as hyperparameters and model choice, although this section will speak through plotly graphs of how the two classes are divided through vetor embeddings and further analysis that's conducted through them. 

Will have a couple tables comparing success(or not) of ML model choices and techniques. Will also reference hindroid and how that project served to be the setting for everything that follows here (along with the hindroid results)
